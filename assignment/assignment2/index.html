            <h2> lets talk about the importance of sleep</h2>

            <p>
                Poor sleep is linked to gaining weight. In recent studies those who didn't get enough sleep were more 
                likely to gain weight. Sleep deprivation causes irregular hormone release which may lead to bigger appetites 
                which can lead to over eating. Thanks to another study, we now know that a limited amount of 
                sleep can lead to the brain functioning akin to being under the influence of alcohol. Like most people have heard, a good night's 
                sleep does in fact imporve problem-solving skills and memory performance. During sleep, we as humans  produce proteins known as cytokines, 
                which the body relies on to fight infection, illness, and stress. There are some people that take naps in order to attempt to
                catch back up on the amount of sleep that they lost, this has been proven to help with a temporary boost of alertness, this cannot 
                however provide the other benefits of actual sleep at night.
