            <h2> lets talk about the importance of sleep in children</h2>
            <p>
                Poor sleep is linked to gaining weight. In recent studies children who didn't get enough sleep
                 were 89% more likely to gain weight than those who did get enough sleep. Researchers have learned that sleep helps to
                 protect young growing children from vascular damage.  As previously stated sleep helps deal with weight gain, young 
                 kids who don't sleep very much are more likely to gain weight and be obese. Although there is no technical research
                to back this up, kids who sleep more are less likely to get injured, as they are asleep and not walking around. There is
                some research that links a lack of sleep in 3 year olds to the increasedd chance of them having hyperactivity and 
                impulsivity problems as they age.
