            <h2> lets talk about the importance of sleep in teens</h2>

            <p>
                According to the CDC there is only a small number of teens that get the ideal amount of sleep, that being 9 hours. 
                Only about 9% of teens get the ideal amount, and this amount typically decreases as they progress through high school. 
                While most of the factors that cause this are school related, there is something that is natural and that is the change
                in their interal biological clock, their circadian rhythms naturally keep them up later at night. A clear link has
                been found between sleep deprivation and teenage depression and anxiety. In a study that involved almost
                28,000 high school students, scientists were able to find that for each hour of sleep that was lost
                there was an increase of 38 percent in the risk of feeling sad or hopeless, and a 58 percent increase in suicide attempts
